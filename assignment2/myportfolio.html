    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I am Lin Htet Aung, a 19-year-old from Monywa. Football has been a passion of mine since childhood, and I've always enjoyed watching films. I completed high school in 2020 and am currently a CDM student. Initially, I joined the math class at Simbolo with the intention of entering the AI field. However, I discovered it wasn't the right fit for me. Nevertheless, I've found a liking for coding and have decided to pursue web development by joining the class here at Simbolo.</p>
